## Introduction

The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences.

To bridge this gap, we introduce **ArtifactsBench**, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior, which is then assessed by an MLLM-as-Judge guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.

ArtifactsBench is open-sourced, including the benchmark with **1,825 diverse tasks**, the evaluation harness, and baseline results, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.

## 🚀 Latest Updates & Release Notes

## Core Features

-   **A Diverse and Hierarchical Benchmark Suite:** ArtifactsBench comprises a rich set of tasks derived from real-world applications, including component-based web development, SVG-based data visualization, and interactive mini-games. Tasks are stratified by complexity (simple, medium, hard) to robustly measure model capabilities across a meaningful difficulty gradient.
-   **A Novel Multimodal and Automated Evaluation Pipeline:** We propose a new evaluation strategy that synergizes automated interaction with Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based assessment. Our framework programmatically interacts with the generated artifacts (e.g., clicking buttons, dispatching events) and captures visual states (e.g., screenshots, GIFs). An MLLM-as-Judge then evaluates these visual and textual traces against fine-grained, per-task criteria.
-   **In-depth Analysis and Gold-Standard Validation:** We conducted a large-scale evaluation of over 30 prominent LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking **94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena**, the gold-standard for human preference, validating our approach as a highly reliable proxy for human-perceived quality.

## Benchmark Comparison

ArtifactsBench is the first to offer high-granularity evaluation (GR), strong human-judgment consistency (CHA), automated assessment (AF), and direct visual evaluation (VE), addressing critical gaps in prior work.
